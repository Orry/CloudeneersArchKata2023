# Architecture Decision Record (ADR)

## Context

For the solution strategy of the Online Trip Management Dashboard, we are faced with the architectural decision concerning the choice of an API technology for our backend services. Specifically, we need to decide whether to use Representational State Transfer (REST) or GraphQL for our API design.

## Decision

After careful evaluation of our application's requirements, data querying needs, and flexibility considerations, we have decided to adopt GraphQL as the API technology for the Online Trip Management Dashboard.

### Reasons for Choosing GraphQL:

1. **Flexible Data Queries:** GraphQL allows clients to request precisely the data they need, reducing over-fetching and under-fetching of data. This flexibility enables efficient data retrieval and improves application performance.

2. **Single Endpoint:** GraphQL provides a single endpoint for all data queries and mutations, simplifying the API surface and reducing the need for multiple REST endpoints.

3. **Versionless API:** GraphQL's introspection capabilities and schema evolution make it possible to evolve the API without introducing breaking changes, leading to a versionless API that enhances backward compatibility.

4. **Reduced Network Round-Trips:** GraphQL enables batched requests, reducing the number of network round-trips, which is particularly beneficial for mobile applications with limited bandwidth.

5. **Client-Specific Data:** GraphQL allows clients to specify the shape of the response data, enabling the development of client-specific views and improving user experiences.

6. **Real-Time Capabilities:** GraphQL supports real-time data with subscriptions, which is valuable for features that require live updates, such as notifications and dynamic trip information.

## Consequences

While the decision to use GraphQL offers numerous advantages, it also comes with certain consequences and considerations:

1. **Learning Curve:** The development team may need to invest time in learning GraphQL concepts, including schema design and query optimization.

2. **Implementation Complexity:** Building a GraphQL server can be more complex compared to creating RESTful endpoints, especially for developers new to GraphQL.

3. **Validation and Security:** Proper input validation and security measures are essential to prevent potential security vulnerabilities, as GraphQL allows complex queries.

4. **Performance Optimization:** Effective query optimization and caching strategies are crucial to maintain efficient data retrieval and minimize the risk of overloading the server.

5. **Maturity:** While GraphQL is gaining popularity, REST remains a well-established and widely adopted API standard. The maturity of REST may be advantageous in certain scenarios.

In summary, the decision to implement GraphQL as the API technology for the Online Trip Management Dashboard aligns with our goals of providing flexible data querying, real-time capabilities, and a versionless API. While there are challenges, the benefits of reduced data over-fetching, enhanced client-specific views, and schema evolution make GraphQL a suitable choice for our project's API design.
