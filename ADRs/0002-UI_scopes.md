# 2. UI scopes
Date: 2023-09-13

Accepted

## Context
UI functionality needs to be limited and UI's need to be defined

## Decision
Active and Inactive users - same UI.
* **Active users** - best SLA's. Offline mode support required. Storing data for offline mode in-advance.
* **Inactive users** - major functionality dashboard and manual inputs.
* **Research functionality (Hotels/Flights etc.** is not a part of project UI
* *Analyst UI* - separate UI for "post-sales researches"
