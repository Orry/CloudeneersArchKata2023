# Constraints
At the project's outset, several constraints were incorporated into the design of Road Warrior, and these constraints continue to influence the solution. This section outlines these limitations and, when applicable, provides the reasons behind their implementation.

## Technical Constraints


## Organizational Constraints
As a startup we use the fremium model for road worrior. We are financed by seed fund for the first round and by the affiliate fees from teh partners.
