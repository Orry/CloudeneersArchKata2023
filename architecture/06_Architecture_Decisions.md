# Architecture Decisions

> "Architecture decisions usually involve the structure of the application or system, but they may involve technology decisions as well, particularly when those technology decisions impact architecture characteristics." (Fundamentals of Software Architecture by Mark Richards an Neal Ford)

In the following table you will find a list with all ADRs (Architecture Decision Records) made for Road Warrior.
